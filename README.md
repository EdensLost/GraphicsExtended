# Zealot Graphics Library

Zealot is based on the fact that this graphics library is built off Zelle's graphics library 
and the definition (One who is zealous, one who is full of zeal for his own specific beliefs or objectives,
usually in the negative sense of being too passionate - _wiktionary.org_) so Zealot gained its name.

 Multiple extensions for John Zelle's graphics.py and a polygon drawer/viewer.

Each extension can be individually used or you can use them all at once 
by importing zealot.py in your program file.

To get Zelle's library go here: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py
Copy and paste the text into a file named graphics.py
Then move the file into wherever the Lib directory in your python files is located
Enjoy having global access to the graphics library

If you want global access with the extensions put all of the .py files that aren't the drawer or viewer also
in the Lib directory
