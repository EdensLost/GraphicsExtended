# Zealot Graphics Library

Zealot is based on the fact that this graphics library is built off Zelle's graphics library 
and the definition (One who is zealous, one who is full of zeal for his own specific beliefs or objectives, usually in the negative sense of being too passionate - _wiktionary.org_) so Zealot gained its name.

 Multiple extensions for John Zelle's graphics.py and a polygon drawer/viewer.

Each extension can be individually used or you can use them all at once 
by importing zealot.py in your program file.
