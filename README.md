# Zealot Graphics Library

Zealot is based on the fact that this graphics library is built off Zelle's graphics library 
and I have been overly passionate about this library so Zealot gained its name.

 Multiple extensions for John Zelle's graphics.py and a polygon drawer/viewer.

Each extension can be individually used or you can use them all at once 
by importing zealot.py in your program file.
